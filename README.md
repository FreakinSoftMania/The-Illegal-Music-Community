# The Illegal Music Community
A library with music for free that is illegal stored.
# Rules
1. Please upload the music with the cover art and other information if available, and the normal title. It is recommended to use [Loader.To](https://loader.to) to download this music and use the lyrics video as source as this mostly has the music only and not an intro from the channel or something else. When you get a notification to download, just download it and click away the opened tab, as it is spam.
2. **NO** inappropriate content. Music not filled with swearing only is allowed.
3. Be sure to check with the <kbd><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66115754/157065153-ec68ef38-2d12-4cfb-885f-c02917b8c5c3.png" width="11"></kbd> button to see of the song you want to publish not already is uploaded. If, you can publish it in a different audio format when not existing.
